# Euler–Bernoulli Beam Vibration

An Euler–Bernoulli beam of length \(L\) with fixed ends follows:
$$
EI\,\frac{\partial^4 w}{\partial x^4} + \rho A\,\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2} = 0,
$$
where \(E\) is Young’s modulus, \(I\) the second moment of area, \(\rho\) density, \(A\) cross-sectional area, and \(w(x,t)\) the deflection [4].
