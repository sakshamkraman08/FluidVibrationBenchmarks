# Numerical Implementation

Second-order central finite differences approximated the spatial derivative \(\partial^2 u/\partial x^2\), and an explicit time-stepping scheme satisfied the CFL condition \(c\,\Delta t/\Delta x < 1\) for stability [3].

Juliaâ€™s Plots.jl was used to visualize standing-wave formation over discrete time frames [5].
