# Spring–Damper System

A single-degree-of-freedom mass–spring–damper system is described by the ordinary differential equation:
$$
m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = 0,
$$
where \(m\) is the mass, \(c\) is the damping coefficient, \(k\) is the spring constant, and \(x(t)\) is the displacement over time [1].

The damping ratio is defined as \(\zeta = c/(2\sqrt{mk})\), distinguishing underdamped (\(\zeta<1\)), critically damped (\(\zeta=1\)), and overdamped (\(\zeta>1\)) regimes [1].
