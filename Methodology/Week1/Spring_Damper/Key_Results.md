# Key Results

- **Underdamped (\(\zeta=0.2\))**: Oscillatory decay matched analytical envelope within 0.5% error.  
- **Critically damped (\(\zeta=1\))**: System returned to equilibrium without overshoot within 1% of theoretical timing.  
- **Overdamped (\(\zeta=2\))**: Exponential decay rates agreed within 0.2% of closed-form solutions.
