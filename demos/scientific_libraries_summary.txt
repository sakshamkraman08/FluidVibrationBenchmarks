Libraries demonstrated with individual demos:
1. LinearAlgebra.jl - Matrix operations, eigenvalues, linear systems
2. DifferentialEquations.jl - ODE solving with error analysis
3. Plots.jl - Line plots, scatter plots, 3D surface plots
4. DataFrames.jl - Data manipulation, grouping, filtering
5. Statistics.jl - Descriptive statistics, correlations, quantiles

All results, plots, and datasets saved to demos/ folder
Each library demo is self-contained and validates core functionality
