Equation Solving Results
========================
Linear equation: 2x + 3 = 7 → x = 2
Quadratic formula: ax² + bx + c = 0 → x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/(2a)
System of equations: 2x + 3y = 7, x - y = 1 → x = 2, y = 1
Trigonometric: sin(x) = 0 → x = nπ
Trigonometric: cos(x) = 0 → x = π/2 + nπ
Trigonometric: tan(x) = 1 → x = π/4 + nπ
Differential: dy/dt = -ky → y(t) = y₀e^(-kt)
Differential: d²y/dt² + ω²y = 0 → y(t) = A cos(ωt) + B sin(ωt)
